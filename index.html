    <p class="about-Me">Hello Everyone, Welcome to my web page. A little about me, I am doing this journey of learning
      and diving into Software developement. My first time really having a chance to work with computers was in middle
      school and it was a big Mac Intosh. My first real programming experience I had was designing my personal account
      over at myspace back when <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tom_Anderson">Tom </a> had created that dynamic
      platform. This gave me my first experience as a pre-teen dealing with html and as young developer I had enjoyed
      this and thought it was very neat coding and seeing the effect rendered to the screen my first DOM. Later I would
      come to pick out a few lanaguages such as <a href="https://www.codecademy.com/catalog/language/html-css">css </a>
      and java and <a href="https://dev.mysql.com">MySQL </a><a href="https://hibernate.org/"> Hibernate. </a> I plan on
      linking a couple of my
      projects I have worked on. This may take a couple of days but please allow me to move into this direction of growing and expanding with your company 
    </p>
